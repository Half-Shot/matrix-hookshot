GitHub Repository
=================

This connection type connects a GitHub repository (e.g. https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot) to a room.

You can run commands to create and manipulate issues, and receive notifications when something changes such as
a new release.

## Setting up

To set up a connection to a GitHub Repository in a new room:

(N.B you must have permission to bridge GitHub repositories before you can use this command, see [auth](../auth.html#github))

1. Invite the bridge bot (e..g `@hookshot:example.com`)
2. Give the bridge bot moderator permissions or higher (power level 50).
3. Send the command `!hookshot github repo https://github.com/my/project`
4. If you have permission to bridge this repo, the bridge will respond with a confirmation message.
5. Note: The bridge will need to either:
    - Have a GitHub installation registered with the organisation
    - The requesting user must be authenticated with the bridge via OAuth and the repository must be part of their GitHub account.
