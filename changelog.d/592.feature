The GitHub/GitLab connection state configuration has changed. The configuration option `ignoreHooks` is now deprecated, and new connections may not use this options.
Users should instead explicitly configure all the hooks they want to enable with the `enableHooks` option. Existing connections will continue to work with both options.
