Refactor Hookshot to use Redis for caching of feed information, massively improving memory usage.

Please note that this is a behavioural change: Hookshots configured to use in-memory caching (not Redis),
will no longer bridge any RSS entries it may have missed during downtime, and will instead perform an initial
sync (not reporting any entries) instead.
